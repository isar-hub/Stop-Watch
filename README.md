# Stop-Watch

It is a sleek and user-friendly time-tracking application designed for precision and simplicity. It offers three core functionalities: Start, Hold, and Stop, enabling users to easily track time intervals.

Start: Initiates the stopwatch to begin counting time. Once activated, the timer starts running, displaying the elapsed time in a digital format.

Hold: Temporarily pauses the stopwatch, allowing the user to take a break or make note of the current time without resetting the counter. This function is ideal for situations where time needs to be paused briefly without losing progress.

Stop: Ends the timing session and records the final time. This option halts the stopwatch completely and resets the counter, ready for a new timing session.

The Stopwatch App is ideal for users needing a reliable tool for tracking time in various activities, from workouts to study sessions. Built with a focus on performance and minimalism, the app delivers a seamless experience with clean UI, accurate timing, and responsive controls.
